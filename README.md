# Employee-Tracker
In this project a business owner will be able to create new Users(their employees) and will be able to track, delete, look-up, and view the total expenses of the salaries.
Employees of the business can log in and will see a different menu of options, than the executives of the business. Employees will only be able to see their salary, and 
change their username and password. 

This is my first personal project using my knowledge of Java, data structures, XML, and a little bit of HTML. 
I hope you enjoy this program and please let me know if you have any knowledge or wisdown you would like to share with me.
